; Change Log for Environment Variables Unit
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Release v3.0 of 30 January 2014
+ Major rewrite of Environment Variables Unit:
  - New TPJEnvironmentVars static class, along with some subsidiary types, that provides methods to interrogate, enumerate and manipulate environment variables. This class supersedes the TPJEnvVar component and the various public routines: it replicates and extends their functionality while also fixing several bugs found in them.
  - Both the TPJEnvVars component and the public routines are now deprecated and have been flagged as such.
  - All public routines re-implemented as simple wrappers around calls to TPJEvironmentVas methods.
  - TPJEnvVars component refactored and heavily revised to call into TPJEnvironmentVars. Some minor bugs fixed.
  - On compilers that support it, anonymous methods can now be used as callbacks passed to enumerator methods.
  - Unit names in uses clauses are now qualified with their namespace when compiled with Delphi XE2 and later.
  - Registration code for the TPJEnvVars component has been removed into a new PJEnvVarsDsgn unit. This new unit is now required only if the deprecated component is to be registered with the Delphi IDE.
  - Fixed problem with compiler directives that was causing compilation to fail on Delphi XE5.
+ Added two public domain demo projects, with a VCL and FireMonkey 2 version of each, along with a read-me file that explains how to compile and use them.
+ WinHelp help file removed from project.
+ Source code license changed to Mozilla Public License v2.0.
+ Updated documentation:
  - The unit is now extensively documented in XMLDoc format.
  - The project read-me file has been completely overhauled re the changes.
  - The main documentation files are now licensed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0.
  - The documentation internet short-cut's URL has been changed to reference new online documentation. The short-cut has also been renamed.
  - The MPL text file's contents have been changed from the Mozilla Public License v1.1 to v2.0 and the file has been renamed accordingly.
  - HTML file containing demo code has been removed.
